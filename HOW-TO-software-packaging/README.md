# Software Packaging

[Munkipkg](https://www.munki.org/munki-pkg/) is a very powerful and easy to use packaging tool for the macOS platform. And since it's command-line based, it's even easier to script. In this tutorial, we are going to create a simple package for the Firefox browser. Be sure to install Munkipkg and download my project template [here](https://github.com/ToplessBanana/tutorials/blob/master/HOW-TO-software-packaging/resources/munki-pkg-template.zip?raw=true) before getting started.

### Preparation

In an effort to keep things organized, I've adopted the following directory structure on our package repository. This also allows us the flexibility to maintain multiple versions without needing to rename the packages themselves.

```
/Vendor/Package/Version/Package/...
```

In this instance, rename the directory structure contained in `munki-pkg-template.zip` as illustrated below.

```
/Mozilla/Firefox/57.0.3/Firefox/...
```

## Download Firefox

Download and install the latest version of [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/?scene=2) onto your system. Since this will be the version contained in our package, it's a good practice to move the original disk image to the `template` directory for safekeeping.

### build-info.plist

When it comes to the `identifier`, `name` and `version` of our package, I've found that it's best to keep it simple. In our environment we only deploy one version of an application at a time, which makes it easier to maintain consistency.

Update `build-info.plist` with the values as illustrated below.

```xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>distribution_style</key>
	<false/>
	<key>identifier</key>
	<string>org.mozilla.pkg.Firefox</string>
	<key>install_location</key>
	<string>/</string>
	<key>name</key>
	<string>Firefox.pkg</string>
	<key>ownership</key>
	<string>recommended</string>
	<key>postinstall_action</key>
	<string>none</string>
	<key>suppress_bundle_relocation</key>
	<true/>
	<key>version</key>
	<string>57.0.3</string>
</dict>
</plist>

```

### build-package.sh

The purpose of good automation is to do something repeatedly in a controlled, predictable fashion. Therefore the purpose of this script is to do three things: _Create the folders. Populate the payload. Build the package._

Update `build-package.sh` with the function definitions as illustrated below.

```bash

#!/bin/sh

buildFolderStructure() {
	mkdir payload/Applications
}

buildPayload() {
	cp -rf /Applications/Firefox.app payload/Applications/
}

buildPackage() {
    munkipkg ../Firefox/
}

buildFolderStructure
buildPayload
buildPackage

```

### remove_Firefox.sh

While it may not be necessary in every environment, I do like the having the ability to clean up after myself by creating an un-install script that only removes those things that my package has left behind.

Rename `remove_Package.sh` to `remove_Firefox.sh` and add the commands as illustrated below.

```bash

#!/bin/sh
#
# remove_Firefox.sh
# 
#
# Created by Jayson Kish on 01/04/18.

#

rm -rf /Applications/Firefox.app
rm /private/var/db/receipts/org.mozilla.pkg.Firefox.plist
rm /private/var/db/receipts/org.mozilla.pkg.Firefox.bom

#

/bin/rm $0 remove_Firefox.sh

#

```

## Build The Package

Now that we've installed Firefox and prepared our Munkipkg project, we're ready to build our package. First, launch Terminal and `cd` into the project directory (assuming that it's located on your Desktop).

```
cd Desktop/Mozilla/Firefox/57.0.3/Firefox/
```

Finally, execute the `build-package.sh` script to build the package.

```
sudo sh build-package.sh
```

You'll now find `Firefox.pkg` located in your project's `build` directory.
